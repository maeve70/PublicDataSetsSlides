# PublicDataSetsSlides

This was a presentation that I did for our NYC Codecademy Chapter meetup. It is a common question that we see on the Community Forums from people on the data analyst and DS paths, 'where can I find public data sets and what do I do??' Also included is a brief intro to Google Colab.

Hopefully this will help you!
